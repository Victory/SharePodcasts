# Building [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Victory/SharePodcasts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Victory/SharePodcasts)

### npm

    nvm install 7.5.0
    npm upgrade
    
### Rocker Gradle Plugin
You must have the Rocker Gradle Plugin which is not yet in maven central, so has to be built from source

    # cd to same directory where cloned this (SharePodcast) repo. 
    #   `rocker` and `SharePodcasts` should be sibilings in file structure
    
    git clone -b rocker-gradle-plugin https://github.com/Victory/rocker.git
    cd rocker/rocker-gradle-plugin
    ../../SharePodcasts/gradlew build
    ../../SharePodcasts/gradlew uploadArchives
